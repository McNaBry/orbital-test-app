            Have you ever felt so lost in a certain module with very few
            friends to ask for help for this module? Well, many of us have
            certainly felt that way before and we all know how tough and
            demanding certain modules are. The thought of having to tackle a
            module alone, especially if it has a reputation of being
            difficult, is truly very frightening. We might also feel a bit
            lonely studying by ourselves.{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            It would be comforting and beneficial if someone coping better
            with the module could offer their help and moral support, be it a
            senior with past experience or a fellow mod-taker. At least by
            finding people doing the same module we can learn from one another
            and find solace in each other. In university, where people come
            and go and everyone is busy with academics, it is hard for many of
            us to connect with others and moreover, find people to study with.
            Wouldn’t it be great if there existed a way (without the initial
            “approaching others in real life”) to see if others in NUS are
            willing to offer their help, or if you’re feeling kind, find those
            who need it?{" "}

            Our project wants to make it easier for everyone by providing a
            multifunctional platform, GrindTogether, which can be used to find
            groups of friends with similar modules to study together or even
            find study date partners (you never know what can happen...

          We want to help fellow students in NUS have a better study experience
          and possibly even increase chances of finding a relationship in
          university by creating a platform where people can connect with each
          other and create their own study groups.
